# NLP_discordBot
A discord bot for my natural lenguage processing class.

To run the bot, just download the git files, follow along discords tutorial to create a dev account and get a api key and do the same for the My anime list API, add both tokens into a file called dcToken with the respective variable names (apiToke for discord, and malID for MAL), and finally run the bot.py program
